# Working Group on Empirical International Studies (WGEIS) 

The Working Group on Empirical International Studies (**WGEIS**) is a small biannual workshop that brings together scholars in China that use rigorous, creative empirical methods to study important topics in international relations. The inaugural meeting is expecting to be held in late Fall 2020, hosted by **DCLab** at Tsinghua University.

Inspired by small regional "working group" style meetings, e.g. [NEWEPS](https://neweps.org/), [SoWEPS](https://www.soweps.org/), the strucure of **WGEIS** will emphasize reading ahead and detailed feedback. The aim is for researchers to gather scholarly critique and comments at early stages of design and analysis.


# Regular Workshop Series

In our regular workshop series, we organize tutorials for faculty, researchers and students who want to acquire new computational and analytical skills. We also organize department-wide meetings for faculty and students who want to present their work in progress.

Faculty and students who are interested in presenting their work are encouraged to schedule a spot with Chong Chen.


# Speaker Series

In our speaker series, we invite scholars both within and beyond China to present their current research so that the lab community at Tsinghua will have the opportunity to interact with them and learn about cutting-edge research in quantitative International studies.
