# Projects

**DCLab@Tsinghua** is dedicated to innovative research that combines IR theories with diverse large-scale data, statistical methods, and rapid-developing computer techniques. 

## Current Projects

### Global Governance Issues

Research on key issues in global governance, advance the frontier of the field, and provide decision-making theories and empirical basis. The issue areas include but are not limited to: institutes and rules of global governance, international development aids, political risks in international trade and investment, international public goods, and international security environment for global development (covering international trade stability, international finance stability, international energy security, international transportation security, and etc.).

### Global Governance Database

Collect, clean, manage, and visualize the global governance data through diverse channels and multiple methods; establish, integrate, accumulate, develop, and share academic research database; form the “China and Global Governance” data platform with strong domestic and international influence and distribute computing resources with open-source data.

### Statistical Methods for Global Governance Data

Exploit innovative statistical and computing methods to meet the needs of global governance researches, e.g., dynamic spatial models, GIS, simulation methods based on Markov Chain-Monte Carlo, statistical dimension reduction techniques, network analysis, machine learning, data mining, and etc.

### Evaluation of Global Governance Policies

Conduct scientific evaluations of the causal effects of major policies and experimental policies on global governance through different research designs such as controlled trials, field experiments, natural experiments, matching, and etc.

### Forecasting Global Governance and developing Early Warning System

The development of early warning system based on data analysis and scientific forecasting is the critical scientific research task in the domain of global governance. DCLab is devoted to develop the early warning system contributing to China’s participation in the decision making of global governance by learning and drawing on the international advanced experience.
